<h4 id="evolution-of-the-web">1.1 Evolution of the Web</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The web started as a way to share static documents. Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989, focusing on text-based information sharing. Over time, this evolved to support images, video, and interactive content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Web 1.0 (Static Web):</strong> The earliest phase of the web, where pages were static HTML documents. These sites had limited interactivity; they were “read-only,” mostly providing text and images. Example: The early Yahoo and GeoCities pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Web 2.0 (Social Web):</strong> This phase brought user interaction to the forefront. Web 2.0 introduced features such as social media, content creation, and sharing. Technologies like AJAX allowed pages to update dynamically without reloading. Example: Facebook, YouTube, and early blogs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Web 3.0 (Semantic Web and Decentralized Web):</strong> The next phase focuses on data and personalization. With Web 3.0, machines interpret user data to deliver a tailored experience. Blockchain and decentralization are core principles of this evolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="web-standards-and-w3c">1.2 Web Standards and W3C</h4>
<ul>
<li>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is responsible for creating and maintaining web standards, ensuring that websites work consistently across browsers and devices. Following these standards improves compatibility, accessibility, and maintainability.</li>
<li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the backbone of web development. These core technologies evolve to include new capabilities, such as HTML5 and CSS3, which add multimedia and design features that weren’t possible in earlier versions.</li>
<li>Other organizations also contribute to standards: for example, ECMA standardizes JavaScript, and IETF manages protocols like HTTP.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="types-of-web-applications">1.3 Types of Web Applications</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Static Web Applications</strong> deliver pre-built, fixed content. These are best for informational sites where content doesn’t change often.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Web Applications</strong> can update content in response to user interactions or server data. For example, social media feeds and online stores are dynamic.</li>
<li><strong>Single Page Applications (SPAs)</strong> load one HTML page initially and use JavaScript to update content dynamically, creating a seamless experience without full page reloads (e.g., Gmail).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="overview-of-front-end-back-end-and-full-stack-development">1.4 Overview of Front-End, Back-End, and Full-Stack Development</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Front-End Development</strong>: Front-end is what users see and interact with directly. Front-end development relies on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create structured, styled, and interactive pages. Frameworks like React or Vue help manage complex user interfaces. Responsive design and accessibility are key considerations here.</li>
<li><strong>Back-End Development</strong>: The back end processes data and handles business logic. Back-end developers work with server-side languages like Node.js or Python and manage data using databases like MySQL or MongoDB. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow the back end to communicate with the front end, providing structured responses to user requests.</li>
<li><strong>Full-Stack Development</strong>: Full-stack developers handle both the front end and back end, managing the entire application. This is valuable in smaller projects or startups, where developers often need to work on all aspects of the app.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="client-server-architecture-and-http-basics">1.5 Client-Server Architecture and HTTP Basics</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client-Server Model</strong>: Web applications follow a client-server model, where the client (usually a browser) sends a request to a server, which then responds. This exchange forms the basis of web interactions.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP Protocol</strong>: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the standard for transferring data on the web. Important HTTP methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data). HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is independent.</li>
<li><strong>HTTPS and Security</strong>: HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP, encrypts data to protect it from interception. SSL/TLS certificates are used to establish this secure connection, ensuring data privacy and integrity.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="domain-names-dns-and-hosting">1.6 Domain Names, DNS, and Hosting</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Names and URLs</strong>: Domain names provide human-readable addresses for websites, such as <code>example.com</code>. A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) identifies the exact location of a resource on the web.</li>
<li><strong>DNS (Domain Name System)</strong>: DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing browsers to locate and connect to the correct server.</li>
<li><strong>Web Hosting</strong>: Web hosting is where websites are stored and made accessible on the internet. Types of hosting include shared hosting, dedicated hosting, and cloud hosting. The type of hosting chosen depends on traffic volume and performance needs.</li>
